# Subjective Time

This is the code for the Subjective Time art project.  Originally brought to the playa in 2009, then ported to Pebble in 2012.  Then
shelved for a good eight years before being revived, completely re-thought and re-written, and then brought BACK to Burning Man in
2025.  The goal for this project (as of 2025-09) is to come up with an implementation for ESP32-based open-source smart watches.

The python code is rough (this was my 2020, I-need-to-learn-python project) but should be sufficiently documented.  For any future
implementation, I want to use the same common set of data files.  Do NOT mess with the format of the data files.  They're pretty
sensitive to modification.

For a better explanation of the project, refer to the /data/attrib.txt file.
