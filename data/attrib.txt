It's about time...

"Time is not what you think it is.  People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect, but actually
 from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly time-y wimey... stuff."

And that's the problem.  Any clock will tell you what time it is from a strictly Newtonian perspective.  But... time 
and space are intimately twisted about.  Events can occasionally precede their causes and the past can be edited. In
a sense, the future and past don't exist, yet we live as though they do.  The terms "elsewhere" and "elsewhen" take
on different meanings according to our lives, our paths, and even our moods.  There are people in your life whom you
may have just met and yet know them as though you've known them all their lives.  You remember events that you could
not possibly have attended with perfect clarity as though they just happened.  People who have long passed or who are
yet to be are still with you in every moment.

There's nothing wrong with your mind.  That's just how time is.  And this clock will help you make sense of it.

First, please note that it's impossible to keep accurate time with this device.  Look to your normal clock for that.
Not only is this device inherently (and often shockingly) inaccurate from a linear time perspective, but even the
interval at which it updates itself is more-or-less random.  And it will sometimes lie to you.

This device knows many things but may only choose to tell you a few of them.  It understands and tracks... 

- the positions and motions of the sun and moon and planets and stars
- the workings of many different calendars including...
    - Gregorian         - Hebrew            - Chinese           - Martian
    - Indian National   - Arabic Standard   - Japanese          - Zodiac
    - Coptic            - Mesoamerican      - Julian

- It may decide to cast an I-Ching reading, draw a card from a divination deck, or shake a magic 8-ball, or throw runes
- It may give you positional references to any one of many thousands of different points
- Or temporal references to many thousands of different past or future events
- Its database contains many many thousands of holidays and important times
- It may give you instructions or give you a quest to go on
- It also knows quite a lot of book and movie quotes and song lyrics
