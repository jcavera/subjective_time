as we await the once and future king
be isolated - be ignored/be attacked - be in doubt/be frightened - but do not be silent ~~~ 0698
be so wildly passionate that they can't decide/if you're crazy or a genius

protect your <?herd|tribe
someone is still hearing your words in their head
someone is still listening to/the music you showed them
someone is still reading the/authors you introduced them to
the greatest borders aren't on maps/but those we draw in our minds
there are people who need you here/and it wouldn't be the same if you left
there are sources of hope all around us/find them and cling to them
this is precisely the time when artists go to work/there is no time for dispair or self-pity/this is how civilizations heal - Toni Morrison
this is precisely the time when artists go to work/there is no time for dispair or self-pity
we all shape reality with the/decisions that we make
you cannot imagine the scope of/your impact on the world
