enough waiting for it to come around/make your own good days
it's going to be okay
make your own good days
sometimes you're shown the light/in the strangest places
the system doesn't panic when people die/it panics when people speak
the version of you that hid/was doing their best to protect you/forgive them for that
what make you different is/what makes you priceless
you are not lost/you are here
you didn't go through all that for nothing
you have a right to be happy too
you're allowed to be better alone/and also miss them
you're going to be fine
