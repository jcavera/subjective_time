!M=10,d=4 (a-1950) snoopy made his debut in the funny papers

at what point are you ignoring/all of the good that's ever happened/just to call yourself a failure? / 
don't abandon joy because it's brief/don't commit to solitude/because happiness is fleeting
it's okay that good things don't last forever/it's okay to simply enjoy what you have/for as long as you have it
maybe there is no best version of you/just you right now/tired and vulnerable and hopeful/but willing to show up regardless
remember that when you leave this earth/you can take nothing with you that you have received/only what you have given
you are allowed to be a different person/than the one they remember
