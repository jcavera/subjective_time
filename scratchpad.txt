*** western australia day ~~~ 1st monday in june
*** check all use of <t - make sure all possibilities make sense!

<t say fuck it and sprinkle some magic on it
<t take a chance on it

create a life that you can't wait to wake up to
if you try making it perfect you might not make it at all/you'll have to learn to sit with this discomfort
go ahead and kiss <?him|her|them ~~~ $qst
laughter is louder than logic and/often makes a lot more sense
never stop creating/do it badly if if you have to/rest when you need to/but never stop
sometimes it's about risking everything for the dream/that no one sees but you
the artist's task is to save the soul of mankind/anything less is a dithering while rome burns - Terrance McK
we have become an impatient species
when you tear out a man's tongue/you are not proving him a liar/you're only telling the world/that you fear what he might say
you make the world a better place/by practicing your art
you make the world a better place
