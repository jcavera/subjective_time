(a-1610) galileo wrote the sidereus nuncius

a lot can go wrong/before it all goes right
all you ever really have is what you hold inside you
astra intra (Latin: the stars are within)
fortuna veniet (Latin: luck will come)
joy doesn't cancel out the heavy things/but it gives strength to carry them
semper amatus/numquam oblitus (Latin: always loved, never forgotten)
the considerate also need consideration
the healer also needs healing
the giver also needs to receive
the planner also needs surprises
the thoughtful also need to be though of
the whole world is a series of miracles/but we're so used to them that we/call them ordinary
we were a story with pages left unwritten/perhaps in another time/we'll pick up the pen and write the ending
what you lose can create space/for what you need
