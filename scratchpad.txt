<?cake|chocolate|cookies|pizza|tacos likely won't solve all your problems/but it never hurts to check
before the <?seminar|workshop on <e starts
before we burn it all to the ground
directly above the center of the earth
enough waiting for it to come around/make your own good days
it's going to be okay
liberty is not doing whatever you want/it's being free to choose what is right - John Locke
make your own good days
on the <?brink|cusp|edge|verge of something <?amazing|big|important|wonderful|revolutionary
sometimes the fear does not subside/and you must do it afraid
sometimes you're shown the light/in the strangest places
the system doesn't panic when people die/it panics when people speak
the version of you that hid/was doing their best to protect you/forgive them for that
there are many <?better|beautiful|good days ahead
underneath the sky
you can't always choose the music/but you can choose how you dance to it
what make you different is/what makes you priceless
you are not lost/you are here
you didn't go through all that for nothing
you have a right to be happy too
you're allowed to be better alone/and also miss them
you're going to be <?okay|fine
