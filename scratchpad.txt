(a-1050) the fall of the kingdom of sri ksetra
!M=11,d=7 pancho barnes day
!M=7,d=7 (a-1730) olivier levasseur threw his cipher to the crowd before his execution
!d<5 yay! you made it to <M ! / 
!h>4,h<11 on the morrowtide
<t get out of your head and back on your feet

after yestereve
be a good person even if/you get nothing in return
everything not saved will be lost - Nintendo quit message
freedom doesn't cancel responsibility
i hope you keep choosing you/even if others don't
keep holding it together/even if you feel like you're all alone
keep holding it together
let's dance
remember who the fuck you are
the world will try to teach you that/fear is a duty and/joy is a crime
you have walked through shadow and flame/and yet you still doubt yourself? /
