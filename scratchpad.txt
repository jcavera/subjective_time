change is freedom/change is life - Ursula K
eighty eight hundred years since/the rise of the ubaid civilization
fifty seven hundred years since the ubaid vanished
in the quiet before the breakthrough
it's not too late
realities are like radio stations/you can only tune in to one at a time
seven thousand years since the sinking of doggerland
silence is complicity
the first draft of anything/is shit
the poor tell us who we are/the visionaries tell us who we can be/let's stop hiding the poor and killing the visionaries
the roots go deep before the fruit appears
there comes a point when you have to/choose whether to be like those around you/or make a virtue of your peculiarities - Ursula K
this isn't about just being happy/this is about being fully fucking alive/grief rage awe bliss - all of it
those who build walls are their own prisoners - Ursula K
those who do not question their beliefs/have none worth defending
twenty two thousand years since/the carving of the ishango bone
you are not as lost as you think you are
you will be found
you're never too old to/completely upend your life
