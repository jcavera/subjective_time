<t seek out what fills you with love

absolutely nothing happened in sector eighty three/by nine by twelve today ~~~ 0028
as children we were fascinated by magic/as adults we fear love/when did you forget that/they are the same thing? / 
ate o fim do mundo (Portugese: until the end of the world)
compassion matters more than compliance
don't take defeat too seriously/you can always start again
every defense was once devotion/a sacred attempt to stay alive
everything changes beyond absolute recognition
finding ways to keep you inspired/makes everything suck less
forty nine million years since heart mountain wyoming slid fifteen miles sideways like a giant stone hovercraft ~~~ 0303
grace lives where the broken/remembered their way home
grace lives where the ending/found its breath
grace lives where the fallen/never truly fell
grace lives where the wound/learned to sing
i'm not sure i like the feng shui here/can you move me a little to the left? /

kindness should not be considered counterculture
no matter how many mistakes you make/or how slow your progress/you're doing better than those who/aren't even trying
no one is worth destroying yourself over
once in a while/right in the middle of life/you fall in to a fairy tale
once in a while
purpose is not a destination/but a direction
silence is the language of liars
some days are just hard/and all you can do is be kind to yourself/as you get through them
someone somewhere is missing the idea of you/they may not know your name/but they're imagining someone just like you
sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do/is have fun
the darkness tried to claim you/and yet here you are/forged by every shadow that tried to break you
the future isn't going to save itself
they built gods made of code/and then begged them for mercy
you can either focus on/what's tearing you apart or/what's keeping you together
you don't have to be fearless/just brave enough to show up
you've survived everything that/you thought you couldn't
