<t remember what has been forgotten
<t remember what the rest of us have forgotten

be the one who notices/you might be the only one
be the one who notices
please try to be okay
sadness and eternal optimism are not contradictory
talent ignored is advancement lost
there will be brighter days/and deeper sleeps/and so many sunrises
these moments matter ~~~ $brc
while you are fighting/enjoy the spaces between where you are/and where you are going
you can start late/and lose it all/and still succeed
you rarely know when the last time will be
