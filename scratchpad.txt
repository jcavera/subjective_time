<t bring your weird

a difficult past does not have to stop you/from living a magical life now
always choose yourself/then choose who chooses you
at what point are you ignoring/all of the good that's ever happened/just to call yourself a failure? / 
be willing to be the dumbest person in the room/that's where growth lies
don't abandon joy because it's brief/don't commit to solitude/because happiness is fleeting
don't allow this life to drive you/into thinking that you deserve less
it's okay that good things don't last forever/it's okay to simply enjoy what you have/for as long as you have it
maybe there is no best version of you/just you right now/tired and vulnerable and hopeful/but willing to show up regardless
no one will come to save you/but some will offer their hand to hold/when you're saving yourself/and those are the ones who matter
proper rest is a tool/not a reward
remember that when you leave this earth/you can take nothing with you that you have received/only what you have given
remember to pause before you/apologize for having needs
remember to pause before you/believe the ugly voice in your head
remember to pause before you/do the thing that hurts you
remember to pause before you/push yourself past exhaustion
remember to pause before you/react to someone in anger
remember to pause before you/say yes when you mean no
remember to pause before you/take on someone else's problems
the faster you are willing to be wrong/the faster you will be right
the people with the greatest potential sometime/take the longest to find their path
the soul doesn't know a thing about deadlines
we may have lost the plot/but we still have time to choose our direction
you are allowed to be a different person/than the one they remember
you are not too much/you are just right/you deserve to be here and do well
you are not too much/you are just right
you can still live a beautiful life/regardless of the losses you've faced
you deserve to be here/and to do well
you don't need a weatherman to know/which way the wind blows
your learning speed is proportional/to your willingness to look stupid
