!M=7,d=14 the death of andrea gibson
(a-1610) galileo wrote the sidereus nuncius
(a-1955) emma gatewood walked the entire appalachian trail
(a-1976) mau pialug sailed from hawai'i to tahiti using only the stars

a lot can go wrong/before it all goes right
all you ever really have is what you hold inside you
astra intra (Latin: the stars are within)
fear only lasts for as long as you let it
fortuna veniet (Latin: luck will come)
joy doesn't cancel out the heavy things/but it gives strength to carry them
life won't postpone your death/so don't postpone your life
one must give value to their existence/by behaving as if one's very existence/were a work of art - Nietzsche
semper amatus/numquam oblitus (Latin: always loved, never forgotten)
the considerate also need consideration
the healer also needs healing
the giver also needs to receive
the planner also needs surprises
the thoughtful also need to be though of
the whole world is a series of miracles/but we're so used to them that we/call them ordinary
we were a story with pages left unwritten/perhaps in another time/we'll pick up the pen and write the ending
what you lose can create space/for what you need
you are reading a book with no way to turn back pages/pay close attention to the narrative
