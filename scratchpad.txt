a lot can go wrong/before it all goes right
all you ever really have is/what you hold inside you
astra intra (Latin: the stars are within)
fear only lasts for as long as you let it
fortuna imperatrix mundi (Latin: fortune imperils the world)
fortuna veniet (Latin: luck will come)
in interiore homine habitat veritas (Latin: truth lies within the inner person)
in the warm glow of the love that remains [also brc after the man burns - sunday or monday]
it's not the weight of life that crushes you/it's that you try to carry it alone
joy doesn't cancel out the heavy things/but it gives strength to carry them
life won't postpone your death/so don't postpone your life
one must give value to their existence/by behaving as if one's very existence/were a work of art - Nietzsche
quis custodiet ipsos custodes? / (Latin: who watches the watchmen?)
semper amatus/numquam oblitus (Latin: always loved, never forgotten)
sit deus propitius huic potatori (Latin: may god be merciful to this poor drunkard)
the considerate also need consideration
the healer also needs healing
the giver also needs to receive
the planner also needs surprises
the thoughtful also need to be though of
the whole world is a series of miracles/but we're so used to them/that we call them ordinary
we were a story with pages left unwritten/perhaps in another universe/we'll pick up the pen and write the ending
what you lose can create space/for what you need
you are reading a book with no way to turn back pages/pay close attention to the narrative
