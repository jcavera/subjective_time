become a sheep and you will see the wolf
come in to the light
every human is the first and last of their kind
evolution doesn't have a single aim
fifty four hundred years since the/beginning of the bronze age
humanity is found in the present/you will never understand your full impact
hunger sees nothing but bread
in the <Z of our discontent
it's okay to stop pretending that it's working
next <?week|month|year will be different
normalcy is a matter of consensus
seventy six hundred years since the invention of the plow
six hundred thirty two million years/until the last solar eclipse
that <?event|workshop|lecture that sounds like it's about <***> ? / it's actually about <***> / go figure
the future is made of change
thirty six hundred years since the forging/of the bronze sword of jutphaas
thirty six hundred years since the hyksos ruled lower egypt
tomorrow will be different
we love you/you are not alone/everything is going to be okay
you are allowed to take up <?space|time
you are imporant to the world
