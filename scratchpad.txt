!h>19 say a prayer in the darkness/for the magic to come ~~~ $brd

all we have is here and now
don't wait to do it later
find the lesson/break the cycle
it is within everyone's power to live nobly/and in no one's power to live long ~~~ 0429
it just be like that sometimes
it's a dangerous thing to mistake/speaking without thought/for speaking the truth
let it rain strange magic ~~~ $brc - Cyanide
never go back to the dark places/that you fought so hard to escape
on a planet that increasingly resembles/a maximum security prison/the intelligent choice is to plan a jail break ~~~ 0431
on the way home
pain and suffering are a kind of currency/passed hand to hand until they reach/someone who does not pass them on - Simone Weil
recognition is seldom equal/to achievement
right now there is someone your age/who is experiencing their last day on earth/and wishing they had more time
some people have guardian angles while others/have a drunk raccoon with a crowbar whispering/let's fuck some shit up
the path home is not forward/but inward
there are places like this everywhere/places where you enter as a child/and leave having grown a little
through the forest of forgotten memories/beneath the ancient stars/the self waits patiently
we are in constant motion
we are searching for ourselves in each other
we deserve so much more than to/waste our entire lives just/to make a few people rich
where there is ruin/there is hope for treasure ~~~ 0418
you are allowed to take a step back
you can't step into a new life/with the same skin
you owe it to yourself to see/how great things can get
