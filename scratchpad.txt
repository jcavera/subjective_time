at what cost are you trying to rebuild the past? /
be the glitch in the matrix that you wish to see
before capitalism consumes itself
destiny is shaped by will/not by fate
even the smallest actions can create waves of change
fifty five hundred years since the basque language/arose seemingly out of nowhere
how high can one rise without big dreams? /your dreams must be as boundless as the sky
if you need a witness/be your own - Epictetus
in the messy middle of becoming something greater
much of human history has been a test/to see how bad leagalized evil has to get/before people rise up against it
normal is not the same as right/legal is not the same as just
once is chance/twice is coincidence/thrice is enemy action
remain unbroken
the glory of creation is in its infinite diversity/and the ways those differences combine/to create meaning and beauty - Star Trek
what is done cannot be undone/but we can prevent it from happening again - Anne Frank
when life itself seems lunatic/who knows where madness lies? / - Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, Don Quixote
you are not defined by your birth but/by the life you choose to build
you are not too old/it is not too late
you can be a good person with a kind heart/and still say no
you cannot remake yourself without some suffering/you are both the sculptor and the marble
you save the world one person at a time/all else is romaticism or politics - Bukowski
your worth isn't tied to your production/you are enough even in stillness/even in the messy middle of becoming
