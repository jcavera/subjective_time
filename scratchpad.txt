blind obedience to authority is the greatest/enemy of the truth - Einstein
even the most beautiful stories have some bad chapters/and there's nothing wrong with that
fill your life with adventure - not things/have stories to tell and not stuff to show
how we do this matters as much as/what gets done
the point was not to break the rules/the point was to build a world in which/rules make no sense ~~~ $brc
this was never supposed to scale/it was supposed to matter ~~~ $brc
we didn't build all of this so that people could/function as interchangrable parts in a flow chart/we built it to challenge consensus reality ~~~ $brc
you have no idea what the universe has planned/so keep going
