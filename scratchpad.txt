<?cake|chocolate|cookies|pizza|tacos likely won't solve all your problems/but it never hurts to check
be not inhospitable to strangers/lest they be angels in disguise
before the <?seminar|workshop on <e starts
before we burn it all to the ground
beneath unfamiliar <?constellations|skies
break the pattern today or/the loop will repeat tomorrow
directly above the center of the earth
enough waiting for it to come around/make your own good days
i can compute the movement of the stars/but not the madness of men - Isaac Newton
if you wouldn't go to them for advice/don't accept their criticism
it's going to be okay
liberty is not doing whatever you want/it's being free to choose what is right - John Locke
make your own good days
on the <?brink|cusp|edge|verge of something <?amazing|big|important|wonderful|revolutionary
sometimes the fear does not subside/and you must do it afraid
sometimes you're shown the light/in the strangest places
the system doesn't panic when people die/it panics when people speak
the version of you that hid/was doing their best to protect you/forgive them for that
there are many <?amazing|better|beautiful|good|new days ahead
underneath the sky
venture beyond the <?familiar|comfortable|known|confines|boundaries
venture <?ahead|beyond|forth
we can forgive a child who is afraid of the dark/the tragedy is when an adult/is afraid of the light - Plato
what make you different is/what makes you priceless
you are not lost/you are here
you can't always choose the music/but you can choose how you dance to it
you didn't go through all that for nothing
you have a right to be happy too
you're allowed to be better alone/and also miss them
you're doing the best you can in a rigged game/and you can still find ways to love and laugh/and fight for a better future
you're going to be <?okay|fine
