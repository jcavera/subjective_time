a mistake that make you humble is better/than an achievement that makes you arrogant
as we attempt to describe the ineffable/hoping to eventually eff it
as we attempt to describe the ineffable
fifty two hundred years since the/writing of the narmer palette
forty six hundred years since the/writing of the instructions of shuruppak
forty six hundred years since the/writing of the kesh temple hymn
however much one denies the truth/it goes on existing - Orwell
if the goal still calls to you/then the dream still matters
if you keep making excuses/nothing can help you
for a brief time you are here/for a brief time you matter
not every day is going to be a happy day/but that doesn't mean that you're not happy
some days the only thing you can do/is open your eyes and try not to/think about what hurts
stopping to rest doesn't mean you failed
there are two tragedies in life/one is to not get what you desire/the other is to get it
you are not done yet
you are not what happens to you/you are what you choose to make of it
you will never be completely ready/it will never be the perfect time/do it anyway
