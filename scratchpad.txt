a new sun will eventually rise/and everything will be all right/but it's okay to give it time
and you run and you run to catch up with the sun/but it's sinking/racing around to come up behind you again - Pink Floyd, "Time"
be open to the moment and allow it to have its richness

keep going/if only to find out what happens next
let life be difficult sometimes
many go fishing all their lives/without ever realizing it's not fish they're after ~~~ 0366

now that you don't have to be perfect/you can be good - John Steinbeck
one step is all it takes/for destiny to rearrange
perfectionism feeds on your potential/until nothing is ever good enough
the only person you are destined to become/is the person you want to be ~~~~ 0366

when will then be now? / /soon! /
you have to stop that part of your brain/that vividly imagines how you would redo the past/you did the best you could
