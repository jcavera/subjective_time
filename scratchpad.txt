be isolated - be ignored/be attacked - be in doubt/be frightened - but do not be silent ~~~ 0698
be so wildly passionate that they can't decide/if you're crazy or a genius

someone is still listening to/the music you showed them
someone is still reading the/authors you introduced them to

the pace that the system wants you to go/is seldom the best pace for you
the place that the system wants you to be/is seldom the best place for you
the system doesn't want what is best for you
the system is not working in your best interest
there are people who need you here/and it wouldn't be the same if you left
there are sources of hope all around us/find them and cling to them
they are still hearing your words in their head
they are still listening to/the music you showed them
they are still reading the/authors you introduced them to

this is precisely the time when artists go to work/there is no time for dispair or self-pity
we all shape reality with the/decisions that we make
you cannot imagine the scope of/your impact on the world
