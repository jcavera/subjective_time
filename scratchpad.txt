discomfort can sometimes lead to growth
don't show them your superpowers/show them theirs
growth comes with stretch marks
have the courage to create space/for what's meant for you
it is within everyone's power to live nobly/and in no one's power to live long - Seneca
it just be like that sometimes
it's a dangerous thing to mistake/speaking without thought/for speaking the truth
never go back to the dark places/that you fought so hard to escape
on a planet that increasingly resembles/a maximum security prison/the intelligent choice is to plan a jail break - Robert Anton Wilson
pain and suffering are a kind of currency/passed hand to hand until they reach/someone who does not pass them on - Simone Weil
right now there is someone your age/who is experiencing their last day on earth/and wishing they had more time
the path home is not forward but inward
there are places like this everywhere/places where you enter as a child/and leave having grown a little
through the forest of forgotten memories/beneath the ancient stars/the self waits patiently
where there is ruin/there is hope for a treasure - Rumi
you can't step into a new life/with the same skin
you owe it to yourself to see/how great things can get
