<?he|she|they never promised forever/they just showed up every day/and somehow that meant more
as we await a flash of insight
everyone should be quiet near a little stream/and just listen
fifty five hundred years since the dark millennium
he asked <?her|him gently/do you love me? /and in the long silence/he found closure
i'm so happy to see you! / 
if you're having second thoughts/that's two more than most people
imposter syndrome? not at all! /you are an imposter and it's working perfectly! /you have them all fooled! /good for you! /
in the time before the severance
just before they swipe the table clean/in order to dramatically unfurl the map/and explain their plan
just focus on what you can do today/to prepare yourself for tomorrow
just when you think your life is shrinking/you will sprout new leaves ~~~ 0488
keep going until you're proud of your work
life is beautiful
love always wins in the end
magic comes in the small quiet moments
one day you'll be far past this day/and you'll wonder why you were ever worried
rather than ask others why they are wild/ask yourself what is keeping you in a cage
refuse to be easily defined
remember to give a little bit of love/back to yourself
she asked <?her|him gently/do you love me? /and in the long silence/she found closure
sing like the birds sing/not caring who hears/or what they think ~~~ 0418
some people punish curiosity/find the ones who reward it
the best day of your life is the day that/you decide that your life is fully your own/this is the day your life really begins
the first speech censored/the first thought forbidden/the first freedom denied/chains us all irrevocably ~~~ 0334
the kaleidoscopic combinations of the pictured present/are constructed out fo the broken fragments/of antique legend ~~~ 0797
the world you thought you lived in/is just one draft/there are infinite edits available
this night will end/pain is not your only friend/stay for the you who made it/the you who whispers thank you
to be loved is to be changed forever
we are here to be human ~~~ $brc
we didn't come here for easy/we came to be torn apart/to let the difficult shape us/without letting it steal us ~~ $brc
what if you let that anger fuel you? / 
you are allowed to forgive yourself for/doing what you needed to do/in order to survive
you cannot keep up the fight/by destroying yourself
you don't have to fit everywhere/just the places that feel like home
you may have fallen so often that/the ground knows your weight/but continue to rise until/the sky knows your name
you weren't born to fit the system/you were born to rewrite it
your body was not wired to process/the whole planet's screams/but you can spit them out into art
