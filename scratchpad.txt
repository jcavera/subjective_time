(a-1816) the year without a summer
<R=20-2000 a tear in the fabric of reality
<R=20-2000 a tear in the space-time continuum

change the way you look and/the things you look at will change
hurry kills presence/worry kills peace/doubt kills faith/ego kills love
presence kills hurry/peace kills worry/faith kills doubt/love kills ego
the first thought is what you were conditioned to think/the second is what you actually think
two roads diverged in the woods/and i took the one with the tear in reality/and that made all the difference
