don't sit this one out
encouraging someone to be entirely themselves/is the loudest way to love them
halfway between here and there
people are not statistics
the management is not responsible for broken vortexes

the truth has no defense against/a fool determined to believe a lie - Mark Twain
there is no glory or heroes in war

you are more than what you can produce
you are more than who you've been told to be
you are not broken/you're disconnected from what used to move you/it's still there waiting
