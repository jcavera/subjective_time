a new sun will eventually rise/and everything will be all right/but it's okay to give it time
a single spark in the darkness is enough/to see yourself again
and you run and you run to catch up with the sun/but it's sinking/racing around to come up behind you again - Pink Floyd, "Time"
art is how we decorate space/music is how we decorate time
be open to the moment and allow it to have its richness
creativity is also a spiritual path
desperation is the raw material of drastic change/only those who leave behind everything they have/can hope to escape - William Burroughs
fear is useless and temporary
friendship is born when one person says to another/i thought i was the only one ~~~~ 0584
good outcomes are still a possibility
humanity is still in its childhood/one day soon we will grow up ~~~ $pbd
in a world in which everyone wants something/it can be hard to believe when someone/just wants to love you
in between multiple timelines
in the fullness of time
in the long run good outcomes are still a possibility
in the long run
it's okay to just feel the pain for a while/and be human
justice is not a passive pursuit/the moral arc will not bend without encouragement/and we are the only encouragement it has
keep going/if only out of morbid curiosity
keep going/if only to find out what happens next
let life be difficult sometimes
many go fishing all their lives/without ever realizing it's not fish they're after ~~~ 0366
nothing will kill the glow faster/than clinging to past moments
now that you don't have to be perfect/you can be good - John Steinbeck
one person can turn an ordinary life/into a love story
one person can turn an ordinary life/into an adventure
one step is all it takes/for destiny to rearrange
only in those secret memories/where our flesh meets the mystical/do we learn our real names
perfectionism feeds on your potential/until nothing is ever good enough
survival is knowing when to adapt/and when to hold the line
the only person you are destined to become/is the person you want to be ~~~~ 0366
the truth is rarely pure and never simple ~~~ 0444
there are all kinds of love in the world/but never the same one twice ~~~ 0686
there doesn't need to be an easy answer/or a simple sign to move forward
to be human is to feel both small/and infinite at the same time
when cruelty becomes normal/compassion looks radical
when will then be now? / /soon! /
you have to stop that part of your brain/that vividly imagines how you would redo the past/you did the best you could
