drag time
thank you for being a friend
we're all born naked/anything else is drag

ahhh... that awkward age/where you're old enough to drink/and too young to retire
begin to weave and god will provide the thread
don't just train for the situation you're in/train for the situations ahead
if you wash your hands of the conflict/between the powerful and the powerless/you have sided with the powerful
in a society where lies are law/honesty is rebellion
in a society where lies are law
one day it might be you
there but for the grace of god... /
try to leave the world like you came into it/naked and screaming and covered in blood
you are an irreplaceable gift
you saved them in ways that you/can't even understand
