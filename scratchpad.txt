creativity isn't rare/it's buried
don't sit this one out
encouraging someone to be entirely themselves/is the loudest way to love them
far beyond reality
fifty one hundred years since the carving of the cochno stone
halfway between here and there
i know it's been difficult for you/surviving it is something to be proud of
in every ending/we find a beginning
in love we find truth/in unity we find strength/in every ending we find a beginning
in love we find truth
in unity we find strength
information wants to be free
inspiration isn't rare/it's simply often ignored
integrity is proved/not proclaimed
keep creating
keep making magic
lost in a fragment of a memory
lost in a fragment of reality
no you won't remember/write it down
people are not statistics

the truth has no defense against/a fool determined to believe a lie - Mark Twain
there is neither glory nor heroes in war
those who labor without purpose/are wasting their time
when they decided to stop trying to explain themselves
you act like mortals in all that you fear/you act like gods in all that you desire - Seneca
you are an accident of fate/alive at a critical moment in history
you are more than what you can produce
you are more than who you've been told to be
you are not broken/you're disconnected from what used to move you/it's still there waiting
