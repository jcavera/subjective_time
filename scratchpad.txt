<t naked o'clock
dance through the endless now
drag time
thank you for being a friend
we're all born naked/anything else is drag

ahhh... that awkward age/where you're old enough to drink/and too young to retire
approaching the age of the wealthy commons
begin to weave and god will provide the thread
being ready is a myth/you start - you suck - you figure it out/you get better
better days are coming
don't just train for the situation you're in/train for the situations ahead
fifty one hundred years since the/carving of the sabu disk
if you wash your hands of the conflict/between the powerful and the powerless/you have sided with the powerful
in a society where lies are law/honesty is rebellion
in a society where lies are law
one day it might be you
sometimes just showing up is enough
sorry for not paying attention/i was having a sheep
there but for the grace of god... /
try to leave the world like you came into it/naked and screaming and covered in blood
you are an irreplaceable gift
you can always decide that you're back/even if yesterday broke you/even if no one claps
you saved them in ways that you/can't even understand
