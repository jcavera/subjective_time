## Welcome to the Sandbox!

This is the location for all of the weird bits of code and strange experiments that don't fit anywhere else! As
mentioned earlier, the goal of this is to (eventually) port the project to something like an open-source pocket
watch.  To that end, I'm going to be making a lot of bits of test code in order to try out different ideas. The
files often represent iterations on a theme with the naming scheme being _01 for the first iteration, _02 for
the second, etc.  The current bits in here are:

- generate_tz_files: create the timezone database files from scratch given the timezone shape files as input
- text_around_circle: like it says on the tin, this test routine draws up to five lines of text around a circle
